# [Undersky Project](http://www.undersky.co.uk) by Richard D'Lonesteen

This is my very first Ruby on Rails project. It's still in development and will be for as long as I'm learning.
In this project I prioritised learning over code quality. It's about learning as fast as possible, thus instead
of refactoring I simply applied the new knowledge to new part of the project.
