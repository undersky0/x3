This is my very first Ruby on Rails project. It's still in development and will be for as long as I'm learning.
In this project I prioritised learning over code quality. It's about learning as fast as possible, and the code quality improves as I progres along.
Thats why you may find same things done in a few different ways and a lot of unrefactored code.
