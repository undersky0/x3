“On a psychological level, collaboration is a powerful tool towards accomplishment. A mosaic of studies has highlighted, in contexts ranging from educational institutions to urban neighbourhoods that perceived collective efficacy significantly boosts groups’ aspirations, motivational investment, morale, resilience to challenges, and final productivity (Bandura 2000).” Not too shabby for something as simple as collaboration. 
We believe in a better world, where people collaborate, share and learn to enrich their own lives and the lives of others. We believe in people and their capacity for good and greatness. We believe that our neighbourhoods can be friendlier, safer and more sociable for everyone. We believe trust and loyalty can become the norm, not an exception.

Undersky is a platform that we are developing to help people to connect, share, collaborate and learn from people that may be right next door. We want to help people to tap into the limitless resources of our neighbourhoods.
We are going to do this by developing a local social community network, which incorporates hire and rental peer-to-peer market and a place where users can learn and share their skills and expertise with real life people. And at the final stages we are planning to develop a place for hyper-local marketing. The platform will provide a framework to offer goods to rent/lend/free to neighbours and a place where people will be able to offer educational classes, tutorship and skill sharing. The company is going to facilitate and secure transactions between its users. All of these services will aid people in communicating with their neighbours, meeting new people, share skills and services, and generate some extra income from underutilized items, skills and expertise. 
But most importantly we are going into business to inspire new life styles and to show people that out communities are full of talented, passionate and kind people. With one simple platform we are aiming to make the resources, knowledge and skills within our neighbourhoods accessible to everyone. And make collaboration, sharing and learning look cool.
